1115,1115,BarackObama,"Last week, voters in South Dakota chose to expand access to Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act, making it possible for more than 40,000 South Dakotans to access health care.

Now, more than 30 million Americans have health coverage, and 135 million Americans with pre-existing conditions can’t be dropped or denied coverage."
1362,1362,BarackObama,"Passing the ACA was incredibly difficult. People who had coverage were worried about losing it, the media was skeptical, misinformation was flying around, and Republicans showed no interest in working with us. But Joe, Harry Reid, Nancy Pelosi and I were determined."
1363,1363,BarackObama,"The Affordable Care Act is an example of why you run for office – not just to occupy a seat, but to make a difference in people’s lives.

1496,1496,BarackObama,"At a time when voting rights are being rolled back, the Freedom to Vote Act would strengthen our democracy and give more Americans a voice. That’s why the Senate should do the right thing and protect what so many generations fought so hard to secure."
1497,1497,BarackObama,"It was great speaking with the @MBK_Alliance Advisory Council, and hearing more about the work they’re doing to make a difference in the lives of boys and young men of color across the country."

1523,1523,BarackObama,"California! You’ve got a big choice to make by September 14, and everything is on the line. Your vote could be the difference between protecting our kids or putting them at risk; helping Californians recover or taking us backwards. Vote “no” on the Republican recall."
1524,1524,BarackObama,Great memories of an important day. 31 million people now have health insurance—and the peace of mind that comes with it—thanks to the Affordable Care Act. Now @POTUS is committed to making it even stronger through his Build Back Better plan.

1859,1859,BarackObama,"Today is the 55th anniversary of the Voting Rights Act––one of the crowning achievements of our democracy.

1902,1902,BarackObama,"We’ve seen the power that our voices have when we speak out about injustice––but we also know the toll that it takes on our mental health.

1906,1906,BarackObama,"Real change requires protest to highlight a problem, and politics to implement practical solutions and laws. As I mentioned yesterday in our @MBK_Alliance town hall, there are several steps our mayors and elected officials can take right now:"
1907,1907,BarackObama,"In our @MBK_Alliance town hall yesterday, I mentioned James Baldwin's The Fire Next Time. From 1962, it remains a seminal meditation on race by one of our greatest writers and relevant for understanding the pain and anger behind the protests. Excerpt: https://t.co/50F9ZP3JhQ"
1908,1908,BarackObama,"And third, an extraordinary essay by the former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff of the U.S. Armed Forces, Mike Mullen, explaining the values at risk when we start using our military to control domestic protests.

https://t.co/Ondw85gQNL"
1910,1910,BarackObama,"""Let’s do this another way. Let's stop thinking our voice don’t matter and vote. Not just for the president...educate yourself and know who you’re voting for. And that’s how we're going to hit 'em."""
1911,1911,BarackObama,Let’s get to work. https://t.co/jEczrOeFdv
1912,1912,BarackObama,"I know the past few months have been hard and dispiriting. But watching the heightened activism of young people makes me hopeful. And if we can keep channeling our justifiable anger into peaceful, sustained, and effective action, this can be the moment when real change starts."
1913,1913,BarackObama,"If you want to take concrete action, but you’re not sure how, we’ve created a site to connect you with useful resources and organizations who’ve been fighting the good fight at the local and national levels for years. https://t.co/2KcB4T3b0I"
1914,1914,BarackObama,"5. The more specific we can make demands for criminal justice and police reform, the harder it will be for elected officials to just offer lip service to the cause and then fall back into business as usual once protests have gone away."
1915,1915,BarackObama,"4. So if we want to bring about real change, the choice isn’t between protest and politics––we have to do both. We have to mobilize to raise awareness, and we have to organize and cast our ballots to make sure that we elect candidates who will act on reform."
1916,1916,BarackObama,"3. To do that, we have to know which levels of government have the biggest impact. Changing the federal government is important. But the elected officials who matter most in reforming police departments and the criminal justice system work at the state and local levels."
1917,1917,BarackObama,"2. The point of protest is to raise public awareness, to put a spotlight on injustice, and to make the powers that be uncomfortable. But eventually, we have to translate those aspirations into specific laws and institutional practices."
1918,1918,BarackObama,1. The protests represent a genuine and legitimate frustration over a decades-long failure to reform police practices and the broader criminal justice system. We should condemn the few who resort to violence––not the overwhelming majority who deserve our respect and support.
1919,1919,BarackObama,"Ultimately, it’s going to be up to a new generation of activists to shape strategies that best fit the times. But I want to highlight some basic lessons from past efforts that are worth remembering:"

1924,1924,BarackObama,"On Memorial Day, we honor those who gave all for us. That takes different forms this year, but it’s even more vital with the loss of so many veterans to COVID-19.

1929,1929,BarackObama,"As Chicago navigates the health crisis, its residents continue to show up for one another in their communities. It’s one of the things I love most about the city—and one of the many reasons it’s such a good home for the @ObamaFoundation."
1930,1930,BarackObama,"Congrats to the high school Class of 2020, as well as to the teachers, coaches, and most of all, parents and family who’ve guided you along the way. Thanks for letting me be part of your big day! https://t.co/RjYvHs2BhC"
1931,1931,BarackObama,"Congratulations to the HBCU Class of 2020! Michelle and I are so proud of you. As you set out to change the world, we’ll be the wind at your back. Can’t wait to see what you achieve."
1932,1932,BarackObama,Vote.
1933,1933,BarackObama,"Despite all the time that’s been lost, we can still make real progress against the virus, protect people from the economic fallout, and more safely approach something closer to normal if we start making better policy decisions now.
https://t.co/pfokyI8GiB"
1934,1934,BarackObama,"Change comes when all of us step up and play our part in this democracy. By encouraging our young people, like these students from @ChiPubSchools, to start engaging in our civic life today, we’re already creating something better for tomorrow."
1935,1935,BarackObama,"There’s no limit to the devotion I’ve seen in teachers like these @ChiPubSchools educators. Their dedication shapes the best parts of who we become.

1937,1937,BarackObama,"The folks of the Chicago @fooddepository—and food banks in communities like yours—are working overtime to feed the vulnerable and families who’ve fallen on hard times. But even as demand has spiked, donations have slowed. Their incredible efforts are worth supporting if you can."
1938,1938,BarackObama,"The pandemic has magnified the financial insecurity of too many American families, the deep and real racial disparities in our society – and the imbalanced burdens on working moms. We have to create something better for America on the other side of this. https://t.co/eyy3dC22Ze"
1939,1939,BarackObama,"In moments of crisis, we look out for one other. And we need leaders with empathy who will bring people together rather than drive them apart. @JoeBiden has the character and experience to guide us through one of our darkest times and heal us through a long recovery."
1940,1940,BarackObama,This pandemic has painfully brought to the surface many of the reasons I launched @MBK_Alliance—structural racism robs too many of our kids of their futures. The leaders on today's call aren't just tackling this crisis; they’re helping us build a more equitable future for all.
1941,1941,BarackObama,"If we want life to approach anything like normal anytime soon, we need a comprehensive testing program. It’s not going to be cheap, but it will ultimately pay off many times over in saved lives, saved businesses, and saved jobs. https://t.co/pnN9KVcvQR"
1942,1942,BarackObama,"While we continue to wait for a coherent national plan to navigate this pandemic, states like Massachusetts are beginning to adopt their own public health plans to combat this virus––before it's too late. https://t.co/Eb2Hz8H8vU"
1943,1943,BarackObama,"We've all had to adapt to cope with a pandemic. Climate change will force far harsher changes on our kids.

1946,1946,BarackObama,"When I think of people I’ve counted on over the years, Sarah Hurwitz comes to mind. She's the talented author of @HereAllAlong, and a longtime member of my team. Here she shares her experience with faith, traditions, and staying connected during this time. https://t.co/pftk4JkhKQ"
1947,1947,BarackObama,"Democracy depends on an informed citizenry and social cohesion. Here’s a look at how misinformation can spread through social media, and why it can hurt our ability to respond to crises. https://t.co/qnLcR3mh8A"
1948,1948,BarackObama,For all of us who love this country and are willing to do our part to make sure it lives up to its highest ideals – now’s the time to fight for what we believe in. Join us at https://t.co/Kboaxi3MVL. And I’ll see you on the campaign trail as soon as I can.

1950,1950,BarackObama,"Dreamers have contributed so much to our country, and they are risking their lives fighting on the frontlines of this pandemic. They deserve permanent immigration status and a pathway to citizenship—as they are Americans in every way but on paper. https://t.co/e4IYqX3WIy"
1951,1951,BarackObama,"We can't deny that racial and socioeconomic factors are playing a role in who is being hit the hardest by the virus. It's a reminder for our policymakers to keep our most vulnerable communities at the forefront when making decisions.
https://t.co/aipc8p7Hwh"
1952,1952,BarackObama,"Although our celebrations may look different this year, our unwavering faith remains the same.

From my family to yours, we wish you all a blessed and joyful Easter. https://t.co/xEsgxOarQ5"

1956,1956,BarackObama,"Some good news: states that started social distancing early and aggressively, like California, have avoided overwhelmed health care systems. It’s critical that we continue to listen to the evidence and experts and practice social distancing. https://t.co/56RgGeAfr7"
1957,1957,BarackObama,"Mayors have been working hard to help us get through this pandemic, and they’ll have just as big a task to help people through hard times ahead. I spent some time with many of them today to thank them for their efforts, and asked them to keep up the good work."
1958,1958,BarackObama,"Through centuries of persecution, exile and struggle, the story of Passover has reminded the Jewish people––and all of humanity––of the power to overcome even the greatest of odds. Michelle and I send our warmest wishes to those celebrating with loved ones at home or virtually."
1959,1959,BarackObama,"Social distancing bends the curve and relieves some pressure on our heroic medical professionals. But in order to shift off current policies, the key will be a robust system of testing and monitoring – something we have yet to put in place nationwide. https://t.co/evkTSrzReB"
1960,1960,BarackObama,"My advisor and friend @cecmunoz has been someone I’ve turned to for years.

1961,1961,BarackObama,"It’s World Health Day, and we owe a profound debt of gratitude to all our medical professionals. They’re still giving their all for us every day, at great risk to themselves, and we can’t thank them enough for their bravery and their service."

Takes a few minutes by mail, phone or online. https://t.co/KzxFJKavmM"
1965,1965,BarackObama,"We've seen all too terribly the consequences of those who denied warnings of a pandemic. We can't afford any more consequences of climate denial.

1966,1966,BarackObama,"So many Americans right now are stepping up to help their communities. Zohaib Begg, a 7-year-old from VA, is one of them. This inspiring kid has been gathering supplies from hotels to donate to the medical professionals at his local hospital. https://t.co/K8Pvp9Cyaq"
1967,1967,BarackObama,We are grateful for what he did for this country. He carried the baton longer and surer than almost anybody. It falls to the rest of us now to pick it up and never stop moving forward until we finish what he started—that journey to justice.
1968,1968,BarackObama,"What a joy it was to watch him pray and preach. I took heart in him saying, “We ain’t going back. We’ve come too far, marched too long, prayed too hard, wept too bitterly, bled too profusely, and died too young to let anybody turn back the clock on our journey to justice.”"
1969,1969,BarackObama,"Rev. Joseph Lowery was a giant who let so many of us stand on his shoulders.

1974,1974,BarackObama,Our medical professionals are heroes putting their lives on the line to keep our country going. Here's a look at how an ER doctor who already fought on the front lines of one crisis makes it through a day in this one. A good reminder for us to help them out by staying home.

1976,1976,BarackObama,"Ten years ago today, I signed the Affordable Care Act into law. It protected preexisting conditions, cut the uninsured rate in half, and lots more.

2355,2355,justinbieber,"I’m joining the #GlobalGoalUnite for Our Future concert on June 27th to combat the disproportionate impact COVID-19 has on communities of color and call on world leaders to make testing, treatments &amp; vaccines available to everyone everywhere https://t.co/3KTIV9xgxy https://t.co/vjRwcLNEBK"
2356,2356,justinbieber,Every claim of sexual abuse should be taken very seriously and this is why my response was needed. However this story is factually impossible and that is why I will be working with twitter and authorities to take legal action.
2357,2357,justinbieber,I won’t be using mike lowery anymore as an alias
2358,2358,justinbieber,On march 10th selena left for work and I stayed at the Westin as the receipts clearly showed with my friends nick and john before I left town. Once again not at the four seasons. We booked it for a couple days to stay for the defjam show but I bailed on the 11th to head back home https://t.co/Ku15SCYz91
2359,2359,justinbieber,The Pics I showed of me and Selena march 9 in Austin  should make it clear that we were together that night and went from the venue to our Airbnb and never went to the four seasons. This is our airbnb receipt where we crashed with our friends https://t.co/4ZDIqjeCIQ
2360,2360,justinbieber,We have also confirmed with the Four Seasons regional manager that I was never on property on the 9th of March 2014 and never a guest on the 9th or the 10th and I welcome all press to inquire with them if needed or wanted.
2361,2361,justinbieber,Furthermore I stayed with Selena and our friends at an airbnb on the 9th and on the 10th stayed at a Westin because our hotel reservation at LÀ Quinta and not the four seasons was messed up. Here are the receipts for the hotel on the 10th https://t.co/hLNHnvJ6XS
2362,2362,justinbieber,However I never stayed at the four seasons on the 9th or the 10th. This person put another tweet up earlier saying they saw me at the restaurant the following night not the hotel https://t.co/K4WHNRlC6k
2363,2363,justinbieber,The other reason this story might say I was staying at the four seasons was because a tweet from 2014 on March 10th not the the 9th says they saw me there . This is that tweet https://t.co/piTHxjajvi
2364,2364,justinbieber,Here is article that shows we didn’t arrive in Austin that night from Selena’s show in Houston until late in the night. https://t.co/BsxCoMasqa
2365,2365,justinbieber,These photos clearly show me on stage with my assistant sidestage and the other with both of us in the streets of Austin afterwards on March 9 2014 https://t.co/WlC6KAvJOZ
2366,2366,justinbieber,This article from 2014 talks about Selena being there with me. https://t.co/Jr2AE0brY2
2367,2367,justinbieber,As her story told I did surprise a crowd in Austin at Sxsw where I appeared on stage with my then assistant side stage and sang a few songs. What this person did not know was that I attended that show with my then gf Selena Gomez
2368,2368,justinbieber,I don’t normally address things as I have dealt with random accusations my entire career but after talking with my wife and team I have decided to speak up on an issue tonight.

6190,6186,taylorswift13,"I’ve never done this before. In the past I’ve always treated albums as one-off eras and moved onto planning the next one after an album was released. There was something different with folklore. In making it, I felt less like I was departing and more like I was returning."
6191,6187,taylorswift13,"To put it plainly, we just couldn’t stop writing songs. To try and put it more poetically, it feels like we were standing on the edge of the folklorian woods and had a choice: to turn and go back or to travel further into the forest of this music. We chose to wander deeper in."

6259,6255,taylorswift13,We need to retroactively change the status of people who perpetuated hideous patterns of racism from ‘heroes’ to ‘villains.’ And villains don’t deserve statues.
6260,6256,taylorswift13,"Taking down statues isn’t going to fix centuries of systemic oppression, violence and hatred that black people have had to endure but it might bring us one small step closer to making ALL Tennesseans and visitors to our state feel safe - not just the white ones."
6261,6257,taylorswift13,"His statue is still standing and July 13th is ‘Nathan Bedford Forrest Day.’ Due to social pressure, the state is trying to overrule this, and Tennesseans might no longer have to stomach it. Fingers crossed."
6262,6258,taylorswift13,"Then we get to this monstrosity. Nathan Bedford Forrest was a brutal slave trader and the first grand wizard of the Ku Klux Klan who, during the Civil War, massacred dozens of black Union soldiers in Memphis. https://t.co/n2DiEt9F3P"
6263,6259,taylorswift13,Replacing his statue is a waste of state funds and a waste of an opportunity to do the right thing.
6264,6260,taylorswift13,"FYI, he was a white supremacist newspaper editor who published pro-lynching editorials and incited the arson of the office of Ida B. Wells (who actually deserves a hero’s statue for her pioneering work in journalism and civil rights)."
6265,6261,taylorswift13,Edward Carmack’s statue was sitting in the state Capitol until it was torn down last week in the protests. The state of Tennessee has vowed to replace it.
6266,6262,taylorswift13,"As a Tennessean, it makes me sick that there are monuments standing in our state that celebrate racist historical figures who did evil things. Edward Carmack and Nathan Bedford Forrest were DESPICABLE figures in our state history and should be treated as such."

8219,8215,KimKardashian,"How could an innocent 17-year-old end up behind bars until he's 77 years old? Meet C.J. Rice - despite being a minor, he was tried as an adult and sentenced to 30-60 years behind bars for a crime that his doctor says he could not have committed.

8456,8452,KimKardashian,I want to thank @LACProbation and the Superintendent for having me and to the staff I met - who really believe in redemption and were constantly guiding these young men towards a positive path. https://t.co/K3jXOnPVGK
8457,8453,KimKardashian,These are the young men that deserve a second chance and if we give them the opportunities and tools to learn and grow and change we need to be doing everything we can to help them.
8458,8454,KimKardashian,I walked away really understanding that these young adults need our attention and will be out one day and we need to set them up to succeed and not go back to the lifestyle they were so accustomed to. https://t.co/N59CyMkHM7

8461,8457,KimKardashian,All the boys I met had made the decision to change their lives and were actively living that change. They were in college at @lamcofficial and some were enrolled in the Hollywood CPR program at West LA College to get into the film unions. https://t.co/yOxlaDaIHq
8462,8458,KimKardashian,This made me feel so sad and angry but I also was impressed with the accountability they were taking for their lifestyle and crimes they committed.

8557,8553,KimKardashian,"Here is my blog post from 2017, unfortunately it has not aged. 💔 https://t.co/vlqoxIf8rg"
8558,8554,KimKardashian,I’m urging our leaders to come together and put politics aside and put children first.
8559,8555,KimKardashian,Imagine the entire classroom of children who witnessed their friends die in front of them. The trauma will last a lifetime for everyone involved. Words can’t express my heartbreak for the parents whose babies didn’t come home from school yesterday.
8560,8556,KimKardashian,"We can’t accept it. We can’t have another five years go by without effective, impactful laws put in place to protect our kids. We are parents, we are mothers, we are begging and pleading for action."
8561,8557,KimKardashian,We can’t accept this as normal anymore. It’s not normal for a teenager to kill children. It’s not normal for our kids to be practicing active shooter drills in schools. It’s not normal to be shot while shopping for groceries. I’m not numbed by it. I will never be numbed by it.
8562,8558,KimKardashian,"but if we increase legal age to purchase, coupled with a ban on assault weapons, we can without a doubt reduce the number of senseless tragedies and save children’s lives."
8563,8559,KimKardashian,"There are of course people over 21 who buy guns to cause harm, and other mass shootings in recent years have been carried out by people over 21,"
8564,8560,KimKardashian,But the one thing that law makers can and should control now is access to weapons.
8565,8561,KimKardashian,"There is no question that mental health, racism, deep-seated hatred all play a role in the motivation for mass shootings in recent years. And at a community level, as parents, teachers, there is a lot that can be done to help teens and young adults that isn’t being done."
8566,8562,KimKardashian,"As I even type these words I am seriously dumbfounded that this is something considered normal, acceptable and legal."
8567,8563,KimKardashian,"Someone who is not old enough to buy alcohol should not be allowed to purchase a firearm. There is no world in which an 18 year old needs a semi automatic weapon, or any weapon, and no world in which the outcome can be anything other than tragic."
8568,8564,KimKardashian,"The legal age to purchase a firearm is also a serious issue and needs to be addressed and increased. The Parkland shooter, the Buffalo grocery store shooter, the Texas shooter yesterday, they were all under 21 and reportedly purchased weapons legally. These are teenagers."
8569,8565,KimKardashian,"Assault weapons didn’t even exist when the Second Amendment was written. We have to stop allowing people to use a sentence written centuries ago when technology, times, humanity were completely different, to dictate how we regulate gun ownership, &amp; how we protect our kids today."
8570,8566,KimKardashian,"AR-15 style semi automatic rifles were used in Newtown, Parkland, Aurora, San Bernardino, Orlando, Parkland, in the Buffalo shooting 10 days ago, and reportedly in yesterday’s shooting. Assault weapons are not a self defense tool. They are sophisticated weapons, designed to kill."
8571,8567,KimKardashian,"Semi automatic weapons, assault weapons, weapons of war, should not be legally sold or owned by American civilians. They should be banned. Period."
8572,8568,KimKardashian,There is no excuse and no justification for what happened yesterday. The current laws in our country around gun control are not protecting our children. We have to push law makers to enact laws that are fitting in today’s world.
8573,8569,KimKardashian,"Yesterday 19 children were murdered by an 18 year old, and I find myself heartbroken, disgusted and furious about how little has been done by law makers to enact gun laws that protect our children."
8574,8570,KimKardashian,In it I asked “is it more important to protect the second amendment than to protect our own children?”
8575,8571,KimKardashian,"Five years ago, almost to the day, I wrote an essay for my blog about my thoughts on gun control in honor of National Gun Violence Awareness Day."
8576,8572,KimKardashian,I am prepping all my Italy content now! Get ready for the major spam! It won’t take me a week to post it don’t worry lol. I just like to live in the moment sometimes but getting all my posts ready 🇮🇹❤️

@ScottyBudnick has really mentored me through showing what the prison system is like and introduced me to so many amazing people."

8835,8831,KimKardashian,"Gov Jared Polis @govofco also announced that he has granted 3 commutations, 15 individual pardons &amp; has signed an Executive Order granting 1,351 pardons for convictions of possession of 2ounces or less of marijuana. Marijuana is legal in Colorado, it’s the right thing to do! 👏🏼"
8836,8832,KimKardashian,Thank you @GovofCO 🙏🏼👏🏼 https://t.co/v0HoGuafnP
8837,8833,KimKardashian,This case was a clear example of why mandatory minimums don’t work and need to be abolished. I’m grateful to Governor Polis for his empathy and leadership on this case.
8838,8834,KimKardashian,"Thank you @GovofCO for taking action to reduce Mr. Aguilera- Mederos sentence! While his new sentence is ten years, he will now have an opportunity to come home in five years and be with his son and wife."

8853,8849,KimKardashian,❤️
8854,8850,KimKardashian,"I pray that Governor Polis, who has been a leader on supporting reforms that increase human dignity in the legal system, will commute his sentence."
8855,8851,KimKardashian,"And yet, for some reason the prosecutor thought it would be funny to post a photo of a brake shoe trophy she received from a colleague with a plaque? Makes me so sick."
8856,8852,KimKardashian,"Another shocking part of the case is this post by the prosecutor after his conviction. Four people died in this tragic accident. Rogel has a life sentence for the accident, which will not only destroy his life, but it will also impact his wife and son’s life. https://t.co/xrYSqL2IvM"
8857,8853,KimKardashian,Colorado law really has to be changed and this is so unfair. @GovofCO is a really good person and I know he will do the right thing.
8858,8854,KimKardashian,"Another shocking and unfair part of this case is that the judge didn’t want to sentence him to such a lengthy sentence. However, because of the mandatory minimums in Colorado, his hands were tied. Mandatory minimums take away judicial discretion and need to end."
8859,8855,KimKardashian,"He was not drunk or under the influence, his brakes on the semi tractor-trailer failed."
8860,8856,KimKardashian,"For those who don’t know about this case, Rogel Aguilera-Mederos is a 26 year old that was sentenced 110 years in prison for driving a semi-tractor-trailer and crashed into traffic killing four people."

8923,8919,KimKardashian,"I am especially worried that Afghanistan is becoming yesterday's news. We must keep awareness alive of all the high-risk individuals, particularly women and girls, at risk of being killed by the Taliban and Islamic State. Let's keep their stories alive and do what we can to help!"
8924,8920,KimKardashian,"We need more countries to open their arms to these people who are living in fear every single day, like the UK graciously did for the 130 girls and their families today."
8925,8921,KimKardashian,"They are hunting for female journalists, female judges and activists. There are orphanages that are horribly selling their orphans for money. The biggest issue is that these people do not have countries that are welcoming them as refugees."
8926,8922,KimKardashian,"But the work continues. There are still female sports players in Afghanistan whose lives are at risk. The Taliban beheaded an Afghan volleyball player, Mahjabin Hakimi, who was in her early twenties and at her prime. The Taliban are hunting for players as well as many others."
8927,8923,KimKardashian,"A big shout out to @Khalida_Popal for leading this effort to save these girls, and to everyone else involved in this incredible mission!"
8928,8924,KimKardashian,I want to thank @Tzedek_Assoc for their incredible work to help save these girls and so many others at risk of being killed and persecuted in Afghanistan. It's an honor to partner and unite with them in helping to bring this flight to fruition. Thank you for this opportunity!
8929,8925,KimKardashian,It's such a privilege to be a part of this life-saving mission to save the Afghan Female Youth National Team! All girls have the right to be whatever they want to be. They are courageous and it's tragic they had to flee their country because they wish to play a sport they love. https://t.co/s9nAD588lg

8931,8927,KimKardashian,He said if you are doing something your mom wouldn’t approve of then you shouldn’t be doing it. It’s that simple!
8932,8928,KimKardashian,He also wanted me to pass a few messages along that were really important to him. The most important is that you have to always make sure you are doing the right thing. Julius was hanging out with the wrong crowd and that landed him in the position he’s in today.
8933,8929,KimKardashian,However Julius refused because he said he has a clear conscience and that gives him peace knowing he is innocent and did not want to be drugged up.

11245,11240,BillGates,@mansukhmandviya It was great to meet Dr @mansukhmandviya and exchange perspectives on global health. India's success with the vaccination drive and the use of technology to drive health outcomes at scale offers many lessons for the world.
11246,11241,BillGates,"Happy to meet Prime Minister @sanchezcastejon and members of his government today in Madrid. Great to see his leadership and commitment to addressing some of the most pressing global challenges, particularly more equity in global health, climate change and food security."
11247,11242,BillGates,The school shooting in Texas is heartbreaking. No parent should worry that their child isn’t safe at school. We must come together and act now so this never happens again.

11353,11348,BillGates,"Thanks @devisridhar for taking the time today to discuss omicron, vaccines, and how the world can come together to prevent the next pandemic."
11354,11349,BillGates,@devisridhar @gavi @WHO @CDCgov @trvrb .@DrTedros  has started the conversation about how we avoid the next pandemic which is important. I appreciate your work on this. We can do a lot better next time!!#
11355,11350,BillGates,@devisridhar @gavi @WHO @CDCgov A more transmissive variant is not likely but we have been surprised a lot during this pandemic. Omicron will create a lot of immunity at least for the next year. @trvrb  tracks the genetics really well. We may have to take yearly shots for Covid for some time.
11356,11351,BillGates,@devisridhar @gavi @WHO @CDCgov As countries experience their Omicron wave health systems will be challenged. Most of the severe cases will be unvaccinated people. Once Omicron goes through a country then the rest of the year should see far fewer cases so Covid can be treated more like seasonal flu.
11357,11352,BillGates,@devisridhar @gavi @WHO @CDCgov The data is pretty strong that it came from another species which is true for most pandemics. People will continue to speculate on this and we should make sure labs are careful. There will be future outbreaks coming from other species so we need to invest in being ready. #
11358,11353,BillGates,@devisridhar @gavi @WHO @CDCgov From 2000 to the start of the pandemic we made strong progress on health and other goals. The pandemic is a huge setback - including rich countries not focusing on the needs of developing countries as much. I hope we can reverse that.
11359,11354,BillGates,@devisridhar @gavi @WHO @CDCgov People like you and I and Tony Fauci have been subject to a lot of misinformation. I didn't expect that. Some of it like me putting chips in arms doesn't make sense to me - why would I want to do that?#
11360,11355,BillGates,@devisridhar @gavi Trusted authorities like @WHO  and @CDCgov need more resources to see the pandemic early (surveillance) and to communicate better. Social media got behind on trying to get factual information out - there will be a lot of debate about how to do better on that...
11361,11356,BillGates,@devisridhar @gavi Do you think the world will come together to get ready for the next one? I hope so but I am not sure.#
11362,11357,BillGates,"@devisridhar @gavi Also some countries did a better job of reducing mobility, using masks and protecting the elderly.

We weren't prepared - no practice in advance.#"
11363,11358,BillGates,@devisridhar @gavi A few countries like Australia moved fast to diagnose cases at scale and isolate people who were infected. They were able to limit deaths dramatically. Once the numbers get large in a country it is too late. So the first few months made a lot of difference.
11364,11359,BillGates,@devisridhar When we have adequate supply then tiered pricing is used where the rich countries pay a lot more than middle income and low income pay the least which is funded by @gavi. When supply is limited rich countries have to not outbid the others so governments are key to this. #
11365,11360,BillGates,@devisridhar mRna vaccines still can't meet all the demand so figuring out who gets what is complicated.#
11366,11361,BillGates,@devisridhar During 2021 the supply of vaccines was limited and they mostly went to wealthy countries. Now we have a lot of supply overall and the problems are logistics and demand. The health systems in developing countries are a limiting factor.
11367,11362,BillGates,"@devisridhar The vaccines we have prevent severe disease and death very well but they are missing two key things.

First they still allow infections (""breakthrough"") and the duration appears to be limited.

We need vaccines that prevent re-infection and have many years of duration.#"
11368,11363,BillGates,"I'm excited to talk with @DeviSridhar today about her work at the University of Edinburgh Medical School and @GlobalHealthGP, and to answer some of your questions about what we’ve been learning recently about the pandemic. #"
11369,11364,BillGates,Through my foundation work I'm very lucky to have the opportunity to talk to—and learn from—experts in many different fields. Many of my conversations recently have been about the omicron variant and how to prevent the next pandemic.
11370,11365,BillGates,Understanding how the connections in our brains give rise to consciousness and our ability to learn may help lead to great breakthroughs in the way we solve the world’s hardest problems. This is one of the most fascinating books I read this year. https://t.co/UaSQV1jbBg
11371,11366,BillGates,"We have some, but not all, of the tools we need to hit our target of limiting global warming to less than 2 degrees. We need to prioritize closing that gap if we’re going to avoid a climate disaster: https://t.co/h6wqiZVgph https://t.co/Mj3df3OVl0"
11372,11367,BillGates,"The world has lost a hero. Archbishop Desmond Tutu led with his values, empathy and optimism. He put everyone he met at ease with his incredible laugh and energy. He inspired me with his sense of purpose to build peace out of the struggle of oppression. I will miss him greatly."
11373,11368,BillGates,One of my favorite holiday traditions is sharing books with family and friends. Here are 5 books I loved reading this year: https://t.co/lhvffVsmgC
11374,11369,BillGates,Mamello Makhele is a hero from Lesotho who traveled by foot and donkey to bring health services to women in need during the pandemic. Her story is nothing short of inspiring: https://t.co/UyI4x0VxhK https://t.co/3MLP5nvm5l
11375,11370,BillGates,"I know it’s frustrating to go into another holiday season with COVID looming over us. But it won’t be like this forever. Someday the pandemic will end, and the better we look after each other, the sooner that time will come."
11376,11371,BillGates,"If there’s good news here, it’s that omicron moves so quickly that once it becomes dominant in a country, the wave there should last less than 3 months. Those few months could be bad, but I still believe if we take the right steps, the pandemic can be over in 2022."
11377,11372,BillGates,"There will be more breakthrough cases in people who are vx’d, which sounds concerning but is purely a factor of how many people are vx’d and how fast this variant is spreading. Vaccines are designed to prevent people from getting seriously ill or dying &amp; are doing that well."
11378,11373,BillGates,"In the meantime, we all have to look out for each other, especially the most vulnerable, whether they live down the street or in another country. That means wearing masks, avoiding big indoor gatherings, and getting vaccinated. Getting a booster gives the best protection."
11379,11374,BillGates,"The big unknown is how sick omicron makes you. We need to take it seriously until we know more about it. Even if it’s only half as severe as delta, it will be the worst surge we have seen so far because it’s so infectious."
11380,11375,BillGates,Omicron is spreading faster than any virus in history. It will soon be in every country in the world.
11381,11376,BillGates,"Just when it seemed like life would return to normal, we could be entering the worst part of the pandemic. Omicron will hit home for all of us. Close friends of mine now have it, and I’ve canceled most of my holiday plans."
11382,11377,BillGates,"In Tanzania, health workers and community members are serving as disease detectives with a new app called Afyadata: https://t.co/OFv7JDpQNZ https://t.co/Yww8sjnYbB"
11383,11378,BillGates,I spoke to Prime Minister @Kishida230 about his new global health strategy and Japan’s commitment to the world’s poorest people. I’m encouraged to see this pledge and Japan’s recent leadership of the @WBG_IDA and Nutrition for Growth summits. https://t.co/7KsiYg4lcy
11384,11379,BillGates,"The Omicron variant is concerning, but the world is better prepared to tackle potentially bad variants than at any other point in the pandemic. Here’s why I’m still hopeful the end of the COVID-19 pandemic is finally in sight: https://t.co/4GVMtiZsuv https://t.co/03y1Or6Ge3"
11385,11380,BillGates,"Great to meet with @MohamedbinZayed again to recognize Niger’s progress in the fight against neglected tropical diseases. His commitment to this fight, to polio eradication and to disease elimination at large will help save millions of lives."

11394,11389,BillGates,"South Africa did the right thing by reporting these cases. They have invested heavily in R&amp;D including genomic sequencing capabilities which have made it possible to quickly identify variants, like Omicron, and help the world respond appropriately."
11395,11390,BillGates,Experts like Trevor Bedford have done an excellent job explaining what scientists have learned so far about the new variant of concern known as Omicron. https://t.co/cix77NasZs
11396,11391,BillGates,I made this video a few months ago to help explain what happens when a virus mutates. You can read more about the ways in which new variants are (and aren’t) complicating the pandemic here: https://t.co/luwOHz0hbJ https://t.co/l058kxZHgZ
11397,11392,BillGates,"I usually read a lot of non-fiction books, but lately I’ve found myself drawn back to the kinds of novels I would’ve loved as a kid. These were some of my favorites this year: https://t.co/ef6sg8MTdV

Which do you like better?"
11398,11393,BillGates,"There’s lots of speculation about what Shakespeare’s life was really like, but we do know that his son died at age 11. Hamnet shares the story of how grief tore the Shakespeare family apart. https://t.co/KrNPsGvcXv"
11399,11394,BillGates,"When I was a kid, I was obsessed with science fiction. But @andyweirauthor’s latest book Project Hail Mary is a fun read even if you aren’t a sci-fi fan. I finished the whole thing in one weekend. https://t.co/Ctv8WCNriN"
11400,11395,BillGates,I read a lot of great books this year. These were some of my favorites. https://t.co/t5AzHkm1z6
11401,11396,BillGates,It’s hard to believe that it’s been 50 years since the 4004 kickstarted the PC era. I still remember reading about its release with Paul and dreaming about how the world's first microprocessor might shape the future. https://t.co/7MDhGok7t5
11402,11397,BillGates,"About 3.6 billion people—nearly half of the world’s population—lack toilets or use unsafe sanitation. This #WorldToiletDay, I’m optimistic this sanitation crisis can be solved. https://t.co/ILNnK3ZkGA"

11405,11400,BillGates,The bipartisan Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act is an important step on America’s path to achieving net-zero emissions. But the job is not done. Congress should also pass the Build Back Better Act to help accelerate development of the climate solutions we need.
11406,11401,BillGates,"Data sharing and global collaboration move us closer to new #Alzheimers diagnostics, treatments, and cures. I’m optimistic about what lies ahead: https://t.co/SazZfc4H7d"
11407,11402,BillGates,"We still have a lot of work to do, but the conversation I heard at the #COP26 climate summit left me feeling optimistic that we can avoid a climate disaster: https://t.co/zLtlcPd2Ux https://t.co/JB3aNbTsAw"
11408,11403,BillGates,Data on student outcomes can help institutional leaders and policymakers better understand the economic value that colleges deliver to students. This new tool makes that data publicly available—a critical step toward a more equitable higher ed system.
11409,11404,BillGates,"Poverty and the world’s top global health problems are closely connected. By improving one, we can make progress towards fixing the other: https://t.co/t439RWZba2 https://t.co/Rcq40MlaXc"
11410,11405,BillGates,"The effects of climate change are affecting many aspects of our lives. By working to minimize its effects, we are also working to improve global health. However, ending malaria needs to (and should) happen faster: https://t.co/t439RWZba2 https://t.co/jp5OK6SVaC"
11411,11406,BillGates,Nobody can be an expert in all things at once. To end malaria—or any disease—leaders from around the world need to collaborate to make sustainable progress: https://t.co/t439RWZba2 https://t.co/il2Q5eRjjR
11412,11407,BillGates,I recently had the chance to meet 36 incredible graduate students working to #endmalaria. Here are some of my favorite questions they asked.
11413,11408,BillGates,"To tackle the biggest global health challenges, all countries must have access to vaccines and other health innovations.

11442,11437,BillGates,I’ve been binging geography videos lately. I liked this one where Geography King explains several really fascinating quirks of US geography (including why it doesn’t actually rain as much as people think in my hometown). https://t.co/XEoErF60UL
11443,11438,BillGates,"India has administered 1 billion vaccine doses, a testament to India’s innovation, ability to manufacture at scale, and the efforts of millions of health workers backed by CoWIN. Congratulations @narendramodi @mansukhmandviya @PMOIndia @MoHFW_India https://t.co/vygRkSkPRm"
11444,11439,BillGates,The world is so close to ending polio thanks to heroes like Shumaila Rehmani: https://t.co/PubfuEMuIv #WorldPolioDay https://t.co/R6bFsfgUHr
11445,11440,BillGates,Our funding is only part of the solution. More donors will need to step up to make sure molnupiravir is available to all as quickly as possible.
11446,11441,BillGates,"Everyone deserves equitable access to healthcare. That’s why we engaged partners like @MedsForAll and @OfficialUoM to find more affordable, safe materials that generic manufacturers can use to produce medicines at a lower cost."
11447,11442,BillGates,"We’ve done this before. In 2017, the @gatesfoundation worked with partners and generic suppliers to bring improved HIV therapies to more than 18 million people in lower-income countries."

11454,11449,BillGates,"I wrote about two ways to achieve vaccine equity in the future. If the world makes the right investments and decisions now, we can make things better next time. And maybe even make sure there is no next time at all. https://t.co/ZdYHMQt7qP"
11455,11450,BillGates,"Still, the disparities in access to the COVID-19 vaccine are shocking and unjust. Only 2 percent of people in low-income countries have received any COVID-19 vaccines. And the gap may be getting even larger as rich-world governments buy up extra doses to serve as booster shots."
11456,11451,BillGates,"Inequity in health is not new. Each year, more than 5 million children—almost entirely in low- and middle-income countries—die before their fifth birthday from mostly preventable diseases. Reducing this gap has been the Gates Foundation’s top priority for more than 20 years."
11457,11452,BillGates,The pandemic has worsened inequities. But it's also shown the world what's possible when we come together. Read why there's reason to be optimistic in our 2021 Goalkeepers Report. https://t.co/2XUNjdwCyf

11481,11476,BillGates,"As we’ve seen this past year, new variants of a disease can emerge over time. In order to develop new tools to fight the disease, we need to identify those variants quickly. Dr. Senjuti Saha is one expert working to sequence SARS-CoV-2: https://t.co/XxexUmVwHo https://t.co/cEbA3TuEos"
11482,11477,BillGates,"But the fact that we can point to positive signs amid a once-in-a-generation global pandemic is extraordinary. With one hand tied behind their backs, countless individuals, organizations, and countries went above and beyond. https://t.co/InzRGXGtyc"
11483,11478,BillGates,"Of course, the full extent of the pandemic’s impact on the SDGs will take years to fully understand, as more and better data becomes available. And this data doesn’t diminish the very real suffering the pandemic has caused for people everywhere—far from it."
11484,11479,BillGates,Initial projections about the pandemic’s impact on the fight against malaria were dire. But that projection spurred many countries to action to ensure that bed nets were distributed and that testing and antimalarial drugs remained available.

11630,11625,BillGates,"I look forward to working with President @JoeBiden and Vice President @KamalaHarris to tackle some of our toughest challenges like COVID-19 and climate change. This has been a troubling time in America, but I see promise in the months and years ahead."

11718,11713,BillGates,I am committed to listening and learning more about systemic racism and what I can do with my actions and words to help create a more equal and just future. Black lives matter.
11719,11714,BillGates,"…in policing, criminal justice, education, health care, housing, the workplace and all other areas of their lives."
11720,11715,BillGates,"The horrifying killings of George Floyd, Ahmaud Arbery, Breonna Taylor and far too many other Black people—and the protests they sparked—are shining a light on the brutal injustices that Black people experience every day…"
11721,11716,BillGates,I continue to be inspired by all of the volunteers (including many retired health care workers and teachers) on the front lines of the fight against coronavirus each day.

11725,11720,BillGates,The 1918 influenza outbreak is the closest comparison to what we’re living through right now. John Barry does a great job explaining the realities and lessons of that devastating pandemic. https://t.co/dG1RKAK0in
11726,11721,BillGates,"Most of my conversations these days are about COVID-19 and how we can stem the tide, but I’m also often asked about what I am reading and watching. Here are my 2020 summer book recommendations (plus a few other ideas for things to do at home). https://t.co/BKlfaP3nTS"
11727,11722,BillGates,"@narendramodi @gatesfoundation Thank you for the conversation and partnership, @narendramodi. Combating the pandemic requires global collaboration. India’s role is key as the world works to minimize social and economic impact, and pave the way to vaccine, testing, and treatment access for all. @PMOIndia"
11728,11723,BillGates,I’m hopeful that this program will improve our understanding of the coronavirus outbreak in Seattle and provide valuable information about the virus for other communities around the world. https://t.co/wnFarp28ys

11731,11726,BillGates,Humankind has never had a more urgent task than creating broad immunity for coronavirus. It’s going to require a global cooperative effort like the world has never seen. But I know we’ll get it done. There’s simply no alternative. https://t.co/lDRkgqJ39k
11732,11727,BillGates,We don't yet have all the tools we need to stop the novel coronavirus and safely re-open the economy. But they are on the horizon. https://t.co/1q7YHRXokz
11733,11728,BillGates,This is a great introduction to computer science concepts for students at all levels. I’m looking forward to joining today’s Code Break.
11734,11729,BillGates,Halting funding for the World Health Organization during a world health crisis is as dangerous as it sounds. Their work is slowing the spread of COVID-19 and if that work is stopped no other organization can replace them. The world needs @WHO now more than ever.

11741,11736,BillGates,"In the meantime, frontline health care workers are making heroic efforts to test and treat patients across the United States and the world. Here in my hometown, Public Health Seattle &amp; King County (@KCPubHealth) is doing incredible work that we should all be very proud of."
11742,11737,BillGates,"All the work that rich countries are doing now to develop vaccines will save lives in developing countries too. Without a vaccine, those countries are at even greater risk than wealthy ones, because it’s even harder for them to do physical distancing and shutdowns."
11743,11738,BillGates,"If everything goes well, there might be an effective vaccine in less than 18 months—the fastest a vaccine has ever been developed. That will depend on decisions we make today, including the federal government investing in building up manufacturing capacity."
11744,11739,BillGates,"Work is going full speed on potential treatments, and vaccines. But people should know that it will take time to prove they are safe and effective and to start making them."
11745,11740,BillGates,"There’s been some progress on more efficient testing methods, such as the self-swab developed by the Seattle Coronavirus Assessment Network. I hope this and other innovations in testing are scaled up across the country soon. https://t.co/qdrr7Qz16r"
11746,11741,BillGates,"The federal government needs to step up on testing: far more tests should be made available, and we should aggregate the results so we can quickly identify potential volunteers for clinical trials and know with confidence when it’s time to return to normal."
11747,11742,BillGates,"Extreme physical distancing measures will make a big difference in the U.S., but we need a consistent nationwide approach. Until the case numbers start to go down across America—which could take 10 weeks or more—no one can continue business as usual or relax the shutdown."
11748,11743,BillGates,There’s no question the United States missed the opportunity to get ahead of the novel #coronavirus. But the window for making important decisions hasn’t closed. The choices we and our leaders make now will have an enormous impact. https://t.co/mAa2XWwBIB

11755,11750,BillGates,Thanks to Norway and Prime Minister @erna_solberg for their ongoing leadership in global health and important investments in vaccines.
11756,11751,BillGates,The international response will require funding for @CEPIVaccines’s development of a COVID-19 vaccine and for @Gavi. Thanks to @BorisJohnson and the UK for this vital commitment.
11757,11752,BillGates,Lots of people in Seattle have asked how they can help those impacted by #COVID19 locally. @allinseattle has done a great job identifying organizations who are already on the ground and deploying resources quickly to help our friends and neighbors: https://t.co/SfjeWBBmNu https://t.co/hNGivjDcRk

11764,11759,BillGates,"We don’t yet have all the tools we need to fight COVID-19. This is an important step toward having treatments, while we also explore vaccines and diagnostics. Thanks to @wellcometrust and @mastercard for launching this effort with us."
11765,11760,BillGates,"COVID-19 could be a once-in-a-century pandemic, but the good news is that there are steps we can take now to slow its impact and help us respond more effectively when the next epidemic arrives. #COVID19 https://t.co/7alFsXL27h"

11768,11763,BillGates,Climate change is one of the toughest challenges the world has ever taken on. But I believe we can avoid a climate catastrophe if we take steps now to reduce emissions and find ways to adapt to a warmer world. Here’s how we’re approaching the challenge: https://t.co/MtZAZHrHyJ https://t.co/MEmsGFsbUN
11769,11764,BillGates,"When Warren Buffett donated the bulk of his fortune to our foundation and joined us as a partner in its work, he urged us to “swing for the fences.” All these years later, that advice still guides how we think about our philanthropy: https://t.co/lmpKbixhOZ https://t.co/UMixa49gdQ"
11770,11765,BillGates,"Diseases that cause dementia are only diagnosed after symptoms start. To effectively treat these diseases, we need to be able to diagnose them decades earlier when they first take hold in the brain."

11773,11768,BillGates,Vaccines are a miracle. But how exactly do they work? I explain the science behind vaccines and why our foundation’s investment in them is one of the best we’ve ever made: https://t.co/fwpQOp93kb https://t.co/ODohrGfsKg
11774,11769,BillGates,Science is giving us the opportunity to improve lives around the world faster than ever before. Today I was honored to give a speech on this subject at the @aaas annual meeting. #AAASmtg https://t.co/03yWD4svD6

11786,11781,BillGates,@gavi There are still too many children—many living in some of the hardest-to-reach places on the planet—who aren’t getting basic vaccines. Gavi is the best tool we have to reach them.  #VaccinesWork
11787,11782,BillGates,"For twenty years, @gavi has worked to ensure that every child in the world is protected from preventable diseases. The results are incredible. But their work is far from done."
11788,11783,BillGates,"I had a fascinating conversation with Vaclav Smil about what bacteria, babies, empires, and economies all have in common: https://t.co/HUE9aiFLZz https://t.co/NBSLul2iMj"

11828,11823,BillGates,"@ewarren I greatly respect your commitment to finding ways to address wealth inequality and poverty at home. While we may disagree about some of the ways to get there, we certainly agree we need a lot of smart people committed to finding the path forward."
11829,11824,BillGates,@ewarren You and the other candidates are having a really interesting conversation on how to solve some of the world’s toughest problems like eliminating global poverty and avoiding a climate disaster (though those issues don’t get talked about as much as they should).
11830,11825,BillGates,One of the many awful things about watching someone you love struggle with Alzheimer’s is the feeling of helplessness. You keep thinking that there must be something more you can do. Here's one option. https://t.co/TQ1Z0lYCkN
11831,11826,BillGates,"We have cut the number of child deaths in half over the last 20 years. New tools like these precision maps from

I guess I’m a hyperbolic person when it comes to love... Or in general. Ha! #LaundryService20 #TimsListeningParty"
14175,14170,shakira,"Que Me Quedes Tu was a love song I did with Luisfer Ochoa, my longtime collaborator from Pies Descalzos to today.

14177,14172,shakira,Poem to a Horse—this was me at the height of poetic hyperbole. Essentially I was comparing a love interest to a horse—who couldn’t appreciate what he had before him. #LaundryService20 #TimsListeningParty https://t.co/DQwMjgYX88
14178,14173,shakira,"It’s a song that has stood the test of time really well—I didn’t perform it on this last tour, but I might have to bring it back! It’s so nice to hear it again.  #LaundryService20 #TimsListeningParty https://t.co/clVdI91U6w"
14179,14174,shakira,Te Dejo Madrid is one of the few Spanish-language songs from Laundry Service—and it’s still one of the most fun to perform. In Madrid especially! #LaundryService20 #TimsListeningParty
14180,14175,shakira,".@BrendanDrums has been with me for almost my entire career and we still do things together (like Girl Like Me), but this is one of the first we did, just me and him! #LaundryService20 #TimsListeningParty https://t.co/FuVhT7DMXe"

14186,14181,shakira,It was one of the only times I actually listened to the label about which song to put out and when. He convinced me. #LaundryService20 #TimsListeningParty
14187,14182,shakira,"When I played my music for the label, Tommy Mottola went crazy for that song. I wanted Objection to be the first single, but I was totally wrong—and he was totally right. #LaundryService20 #TimsListeningParty https://t.co/3sErNm2Am1"

14190,14185,shakira,"Underneath was another of my first songs written in English…we did the video with Herb Ritts, an iconic photographer whose black and white images I really loved and who I was dying to work with. #LaundryService20 #TimsListeningParty https://t.co/s5vEONu3lN"
14191,14186,shakira,I wanted to do a tango because at the time I was dating an Argentinian and was learning the dance and was immersed in the Argentine culture. #LaundryService20 #TimsListeningParty
14192,14187,shakira,"Objection was the very first song I wrote in English, on a mattress in the bedroom of my Miami apartment, with a thesaurus in hand, when I could barely speak the language! #LaundryService20 #TimsListeningParty https://t.co/blGxTmRXAz"

15361,15356,ddlovato,was finally proven to be BIGGER than the hate they tried to keep us down with. That’s all 💞 also feeling so thoughtful today so I’m rambling 😂
15362,15357,ddlovato,"Also I wrote that tweet after  watching a video a friend sent me of the streets celebrating in West Hollywood today, I broke down in tears of gratitude. I wanted to share that with you because the love I saw my queer community sharing between one another..."

15364,15359,ddlovato,Remember when we didn’t all think the same? (It’s still happening) Opinions differ - I wasn’t “commanding” anyone to do anything. Now go out and celebrate or meme IF YOU PLEASE - DO YOU - all I’m saying is hatred DIDN’T work for the last administration ✌🏼
15365,15360,ddlovato,"Look, y’all do what you want. I don’t normally tweet because it pisses someone off but I stopped caring a long time ago. Just trying to spread love and light today... after all that is what we fought for right?"
15366,15361,ddlovato,"Today isn’t about celebrating in the face of those that oppose your views and values, but celebrating from a place of LOVE - combating the hate that has encompassed and oppressed so many of us the past four years. Let the healing begin. 🙏🏼"
